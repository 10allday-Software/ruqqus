# FAQ

## What is the First Amendment?

The First Amendment to the United States Constitution states:

> Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.

The First Amendment applies to the United States Federal government. The Fourteenth Amendment applies the First Amendment to the fifty State governments as well.

The First Amendment does not grant the right of free speech. Rather, it prevents the government from violating the pre-existing human right to free speech which is granted by God or Nature. This is an important distinction: you have a basic human right to free speech even if you don't live in the United States.

## Is all speech free speech?

Not quite. There are a few categories of speech which are not protected by the First Amendment:

* Obscenity (i.e. pornographic material)
* Fighting words (i.e. incitement to violence)
* Advocacy of imminent lawless behavior
* Threats and intimidation
* Defamation (Negative remarks about someone else which the speaker knows to be factually untrue)

Additionally, there are legal restrictions on certain specific types of speech. Examples of these restrictions include content that violates another person's intellectual property rights, weapon design information that cannot be exported, and content under a court-issued non-disclosure order ("gag order").

Everything else is free speech, protected by the First Amendment.

## What makes Ruqqus different from other platforms?

The First Amendment only applies to the US federal and state governments. Private entities are allowed to set rules and restrict speech on their property or, in the case of internet services, on their platforms.

Ruqqus chooses not to. Therefore, only non-First-Amendment-protected speech is disallowed on Ruqqus.

## Why is that important?

Most other platforms set rules regarding what may be said on the platform. These rules often have the effect of quashing opinions, viewpoints, and facts that disagree with the platform owner's political stance.

Additionally, other countries such as Germany, the United Kingdom, and China have legal prohibitions on speech that the government deems to be "offensive". These laws violate their citizens' human rights to free speech. Platforms with assets, personnel, or data in these countries must follow those anti-free-speech laws or face prosecution.

## How does Ruqqus protect my freedom of speech?

First and foremost, Ruqqus is 100% located within the United States. Since no foreign government has jurisdiction over any part of Ruqqus, Ruqqus can protect the identities and data of its foreign users as if they were in the United States.

Secondly, Ruqqus is open-source. Anyone is free to examine the inner workings of Ruqqus. We don't have secret algorithms that decide what you should or shouldn't see. Our voting and ranking systems are fully transparent and free of artificial manipulation.
