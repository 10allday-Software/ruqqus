# Ruqqus Contributor Information

Commits made to the master branch will immediately deploy to https://ruqqus-staging.herokuapp.com. If you are signed into the staging app as a level 3 admin or higher, 500 errors will display the crash message in-browser.

Owners and deputy owners can provision branch-specific clones of the staging app for any open PR upon request. Contact captainmeta4 for this if needed.

The staging application must be manually promoted to production by captainmeta4.
